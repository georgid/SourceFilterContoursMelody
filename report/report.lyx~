Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Detecting vocal segments is an important problem (copy from Lehner).
 Compared to speech, usually singing segments non-interrupted by pauses
 are longer.
 A segment corresponds to a melodic phrase.
 Segmentation into some candidate segments might be meaningful for singing
 voice detection, because the nature of voice within a segment usually have
 coherent characteristics: similar amplitude, pitch and timbre.
 Despite that, in most VD approaches disision is taken per frame, the context
 of a contour is lost.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand detection of pitch contours has been used for predominant
 melody extraction [Justin].

\color inherit
.
 Candidate segments pitch-continuous and salience-continuous nature are
 selected and classified as being from main melody or not [Rachel].
 Using only pitch-salience features gives VD with false alarm in the order
 of.
 One reason is that salient contours from background instruments are detected
 as vocal.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this work we tackle the problem of VD by extending a contour-classification
 based approach for melody extraction by adding timbral features to the
 classifier.
 In particular we exploit features that capture the fluctuating timbre of
 singing voice compared to other instruments

\begin_layout Standard
A contour has continuous pitch, so relatively same pitch .
 IF no big pitch range of pitch, relatively similar spectral shape for a
 musical instrument.
 But a vocal contour might vary the the timbre because of vowels.

\begin_layout Standard
We assume that any appearance of singing will be only considerd as 'lead
 instrument' e.g.
 not being accompaniment or backing voice.
 Contours are extracted 
\color red
using the salience function based on ..HERE Justin (see Juanjo)
\color inherit
.
 We have adopted the approach for classification of contours presented in
 [Bitt].

\color inherit
 The thresholding is necessary to discard regions with no predominant nature.
 Thus remaining regions with no predominant pitch are considered as non-vocal
 already at this stage.

\begin_layout Standard
If contradictory frames are assigned a contour, their voicing is decided
 in the context of the whole contour.
 This is a more informed decision because a vocal contour has coherent salience.
